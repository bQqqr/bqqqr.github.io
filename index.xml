When a register is designated as preserved across calls, it means that the caller can count on the register having the same contents before and after a subprogram call. If the subprogram uses one of these registers, it should take measures to save the register value before changing it and restore the value before returning.

Warning Invoking network scan techniques on systems, hosts or network ranges other than those under the own responsibility is illegal in quite a few jurisdictions. 🎯 Target Specification Firstly, you must choose your targets.
Scan a single ipv4 address. nmap 192.168.1.1
Scan multiple ipv4 addresses.
nmap 192.168.1.1 192.168.1.2
Scan a range of ipv4 addresses.</description></item><item><title>Contact</title><link>https://bqqqr.github.io/contact/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://bqqqr.github.io/contact/</guid><description>My email address is me@christoskaltsas.com
