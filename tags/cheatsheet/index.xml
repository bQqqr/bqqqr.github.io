Warning Invoking network scan techniques on systems, hosts or network ranges other than those under the own responsibility is illegal in quite a few jurisdictions. 🎯 Target Specification Firstly, you must choose your targets.
Scan a single ipv4 address. nmap 192.168.1.1
Scan multiple ipv4 addresses.
nmap 192.168.1.1 192.168.1.2
Scan a range of ipv4 addresses.</description></item></channel></rss>
